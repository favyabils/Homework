#What is OOP
"""
OOP is a programming pattern that is built around objects or entities, so it's called object-oriented programming.
"""
#Explain Polymorphism
"""
Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways
 depending on the context in which they are used. 
 Polymorphism is the ability of any data to be processed in more than one form. 
 The word itself indicates the meaning as poly means many and morphism means types. 
"""

#Explain Inheritance
"""
In object-oriented programming (OOP),
 inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
 It's a programming procedure that allows you to reuse code by referencing the behaviors and data of an object. In other words,
 a class that inherits from another class shares all the attributes and methods of the referenced class.
"""
#Explain encalpsulation
"""
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
Encapsulation means containing all important information inside an object, and only exposing selected information to the outside world.
In terms of OOP, this means keeping all fields private, and providing public methods for accessing 
and setting this data if it is needed outside the class.
This is done to protect the data from accidental modification, and to provide a clear interface for interacting with the object.
"""

#EXplain Data abstraction
"""
 used to hide the irrelevant data/class in order to reduce the complexity.
  is used to hide irrelevant details from the user and show the details that are relevant to the users.
  It enables programmers to hide complex implementation details while just showing users the most crucial data and functions.
